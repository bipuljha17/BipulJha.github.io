			<h2>Work Experience</h2>
			<h3>Senior Frontend developer VISA ~ 2015-Present</h3>
				<h4>1.  Responsive Purchase alerts website for all VISA card holders</h4>
				<p>
					Developed resonsive website using react and backbone JS to enable all visa card holders to configure and receive alerts for any transaction they made.
					This was a mandate in the USA for all card providers(Banks) to have a mechanism to send alerts for each transaction to the user,
					which reduces fraud. This web application is accessibility complaint and also generates google analytics reports. 
					We also implemented <strong>Adaptive Behavioural Authentication</strong> for this website, Where instead of username/passwor combination alone,
					the user is authenticated based on the kind of interaction he usually has with the device.
				</p>
				<h4>2.  Issuer Onboarding tool</h4>
				<p>
					To Onboard an issuer(Bank) on to visa system, we developed this onboarding tool. This is a very complex web application,
					which is developed using React/Redux javascript frameworks. This tool also enables an admin to maintain features and multiple versions of issuer apps in playstore/appstore. 
					This tool could be used by banks as well as VISA internal admins. 
					This project required much more discussions with Architects, UX designers and Product owners to understand the solution, also suggest them a better approach.
				</p>

				<h4>1.  Responsive Mobie website for banks in USA</h4>

					Developed white labeled banking apps using react js and backbone js. This solution adheres to WCAG AA
					accessibility requirements. Google analytics was also integrated with this website. Common components 
					architecture was followed, and we created resusable components and bundles that could be utilized by any other
					react js based website in VISA. More than 70 banks in USA are using our solution as their banking website.
